    "In this course, we will cover topics including (but not limited to)  data structures, iteration and recursion, abstraction, organize and modulararize, algorithms, and complexity. \n",

    "**What we will learn**\n",
    "- learn computational modes of thinking\n",
    "- master the art of computational problem solving\n",
    "- make computers do what you want them to do\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fundamentally, what does a computer do?**\n",
    "- performs calculations (a billion per second!)\n",
    "- stores memory\n",
    "    \n",
    "> Is a billion opperations a second fast?\n",
    "- This is debatable. There are $10^{123}$ possible chess games ($10^{80}$ is the number of atoms in the observable universe). If you want to find your best move in the chess game you're going to have to be more clever then the simple opperations the computer is provided with. \n",
    " \n",
    "There are limits to the computers ability  think of accurate weather predictions of cracking encryptying schemes. But this course is about finding work arounds and being clever about your solutions to these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want a computer to compute something then we must ask: What is the knowledge the computer needs to solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Types of knowledge** \n",
    "- Declarative Knowledge \n",
    "    - statements of fact\n",
    "    - \"There is candy under the desk\"\n",

    "    - A recipe\n",

    "\n",
    "We are not going to write code with these primitives. That is why programming languages are made, to simplify this process. The **Turing Complete Property**, a fundamental to computer science, states:  **Anything computatble in one language is computable in another language**.\n",

    "- syntactic errors (grammar mistakes)\n",
    "    - common and easily caught\n",

    "Objects have a type that defines the kinds of things programs can do to them. The type tells programs whether they can act on it or not. \n",
